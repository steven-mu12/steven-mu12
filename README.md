## Hi, My name is Steven ðŸš€

Welcome to my github profile, a collection of all my projects! I am currently a 4th year student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Engineering.

My professional interest lie in low level embedded software and FPGA development. More specifically, applications involving bare-metal board bringup - including driver development, bootloaders, RTOS kernels, and embedded Linux applications. I enjoy working close to the hardware and building fast and reliable systems from the ground up.

For more info about these projects or myself, please visit my website:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SprinterOS - A board bringup project for STM, completely bare metal, featuring my own bootloader, OS kernel and drivers
